`frattlesnake` is a bridge and library from KoLmafia's Java environment to Python. It is extremely ðŸš§ under construction ðŸš§ but it is usable!

For now just clone this repo and play with the examples. It will even download the latest `kolmafia.jar` for you to hook into.

Requirements
====

* Python 3.8+
* I am running the same version of Java that was used to compile the JAR on the build server just in case.

Development
===

```shell
poetry install
```

to install our dependencies and then just run your file! You may need to manually specify the path to your `libjvm.so`. For example, on my machine I needed to run

```shell
JVM_PATH=~/.jenv/versions/1.8/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so python ./example.py
```

because I use `jEnv` to manage my Java versions. And that path is totally different in my Java 11 directory so it's a pain for now.
